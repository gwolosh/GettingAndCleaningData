# GettingAndCleaningData
##Course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to produce a "tidy" dataset from data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The description of the dataset is here -- http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

and the dataset itself is here --

The instructions for the project are as follows:<br>
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. <br>
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br> 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. <br>
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This change is to see how this is picked up in Bloodhound
